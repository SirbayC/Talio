<b>Reviewing the so far process</b><br>
-	Everyone talked about what they did this week. Who did what can be checked in gitlab. 
-	A new system should be considered. Thomas is reviewing most MR’s. 
-	It is suggested to have deadlines on reviews. 
-	Deadlines should be x days, and the person creating the MR should notify the group in the group chat.
-	This should be updated in the CC.
-	Reviews don’t have to be super in depth, but rather issues should be pointed out.
-	Pipelines shouldn’t fail on main
-	It is suggested to assign reviewers based on the amount of reviews they have done so far.


<b>Heuristic Evaluation Draft</b>
-	Draft should be ready on Friday if we want feedback on it.
-	We should choose the group ourselves. 
-	We should write up a methodology for another team.
-	We receive a review with issues users could encounter.
-	The lecture can be watched again where everything is clear what was meant by the assignment.
-	Video material is not permitted to be shared with the other team.
-	Methodology: we give tasks to the other team and they should describe how easy it is to solve the task.
-	We can provide them with our app or mocks


<b>Distribution of the workload</b>
-	Everyone did frontend and backend so we do not have to take that into account when assigning tasks.
- Tasks were distributed and can be checked on gitlab.


<b>Question round</b>
-	We should contact Sare, and if we encounter problems we should resort to talking to the TA.
-	Snacks!!
-	Feedback on buddycheck from TA will be given soon.
-	Everyone was passed on buddycheck, but it will be said if you would’ve failed. 
-	Next time follow the rubric that is uploaded on the course surfdrive. 
-	Write at least a couple sentences for the next buddycheck.


<b>Feedback from the TA</b>
-	We looked at the feedback he sent on Brightspace. 
-	Weights correspond to the number of hours, they should be updated over time if more time is spent on an issue then estimated.
-	Tasks don’t close automatically. 
-	Don’t do 2 assignees on an MR.
-	For tasks you can create 2 branches so multiple people can still work on the same issue.
-	Next week we will receive feedback on how we distributed the work.
-	We are on track!
-	Try to work uniformly, not miss a week and work double the next.
-	Labels and weights should be paid attention to, according to the feedback on Brightspace.
-	Reply more to TA's messages on mattermost. 
-	If you failed the MR, you can do the repair in the assignments tab on Brightspace.
-	You can only fail 1 missed MR deadline, otherwise consider yourself out. 
-	Every fail/passed assignment will be made available by the end of the week in Brightspace.
