# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

### Focused Commits

>Grade: **Very Good**

Feedback: How good your commits were. Were they Focused/Clear?
#### Tops:
- [This](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-65/-/commit/f45741d1bce3dec677495693015ffe88ff164554) type of commit is good, because it has a good message and covers only one Class and testClass.
#### Tips:
- Please do not change random things in a commit. For example, [here](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-65/-/commit/189066c4cf1c433d34daf646d141169df50c6853) why is the README fixed?

### Isolation

>Grade: **Good**

Feedback: This represents the Isolation of your branches and MRs. Is a branch covering one feature? Is an MR too comprehensive? Did you push code directly to main?
#### Tops:
- The MRs look good in terms of scope, [usually](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-65/-/merge_requests/18) there is just one feature that they encapsulate.
#### Tips:
- [Some](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-65/-/merge_requests/17) MRs have a lot of changes that should not be there. Do not fix issues with checkstyle in a feature MR.

### Review-ability
>Grade: **Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Most MRs do not have too many commits.
- The code is well documented, especially [here](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-65/-/merge_requests/18#50337ae5590995e8e0e16567a1cd0a28dc1d5013).
#### Tips:
- The MRs should have a better description. You should improve this.

### Code Reviews
>Grade: **Good**

Feedback: You have great comments on the two MRs to main.
#### Tips: 
- You should not fix the issues you commented **yourself**, please make the assignee do that!
- More people should do reviews.
#### Keep in mind:
- The more targeted the comments are, the better. (i.e. if it is evident that they are directed at the lines of code, method or class in question)
- The more improvements I see from the comments, the better.

### Build Server
>Grade: **Very good**

Feedback: The pipeline did not fail too often, and when it did, it was on feature branches. Those were also fixed. The build time is fast and there are frequent commits.
#### Tip:
- Push more frequently to avoid conflicts when working together!
