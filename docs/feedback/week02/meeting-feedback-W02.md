### Formative Assessment Week 2
- **Chair**: Cosmin
- **Notetaker**: Sare


### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

### Agenda

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Good discussion points. (They are very in depth which is very good)
- I like that you included specific points to get feedback on.
- It is good that you included the chairman and minute taker for this week!
#### Tips:
- A lot of things do not need to be included in the official meeting (like checking the example, defining terms or choosing a name). The point of the official meeting is for you to have already identified things and ask for feedback on them, not to decide them on the spot.
- Only discussion points, no elements regarding check-in, stand up meeting and closing.
- Ok structure, but can be improved.
- You should have time slots for each discussion point.
