## Backlog Feedback

### Submission

>Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: 
- I would say it's good enough as a starting point, however I would like you to go more in depth by making the user stories more atomic, finding more to add based on the client QnAs (also about the Admin) and making the acceptance criteria clear like you see in the slides. Also, do not forget Epics!
### Backlog Structure

>Mark: **Fail**

Feedback: 
- The lack of epics and acceptance criteria subsections makes this a fail for now, but hopefully by the final deadline you should get the hang of it and write a very good backlog.
- The Markdown format and the user stories gathered so far makes this a good starting point.

### Epics

>Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: Is in MOSCOW format, so it does not have any mention of epics.
#### Tips:
- Parse from MOSCOW to Epics by final deadline.

### User Stories

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: 
- I like the way you wrote some of the user stories, but most can be split up in multiple user stories that are more atomic or can have a better representation of acceptance criteria. Please try to follow the example in the lectures and try to find more user stories from the client QnAs.

### Acceptance Criteria

>Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback:
- Every user story should be small and understandable or have at least a couple of concrete acceptance criteria.
  - One or two of yours have acceptance criteria, but they could be written more exactly, and you could add more of these to unclear stories.
>Example: 
> - As a user I want to be able to see my profile, so that I can edit my pictures. 
>   - A button to access the profile exists.
>   - When clicking it, a profile page appears.
