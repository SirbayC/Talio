3. Conclude work on the Code of Conduct:
   - Requesting feedback from the TA on the current work
   - Requesting clarifications on different subpoints of the Code of Conduct, e.g. “Team name”, “Assignment description”, “Products”, “Norms or evaluation criteria”
   - Choose a team + app name
   - Refer more thoroughly to how we will implement different parts of the Scrum mode in our project (as described in the project-management lecture); refer to different aspects:
      - Burndown Chart implementation
      - Organizing the Daily Scrum
      - Defining when something gets to be included in the Increment (is “done” – as suggested)
      - Deciding on a Development Iteration period (preferably 1 week, to align with the TA Meetings)
      - Carrying through Sprint Retrospectives
      - (Extra) Checkstyle rules?
4. Start developing the Backlog:
   - Consider the Lecture given on Requirements Engineering:
      - Identify Stakeholders and key Terminology
      - Define *Epics*, *User Stories*, and additionally *Acceptance Criteria*
      - Establish a priority to adhere to throughout the development process
   - Check the last year’s example
   - Mind the first and second Client Q&As:
      - Each member of the team should be able to contribute with some ideas from them (which subsequently requires participation)
      - Establish a list of potential questions to be asked in the final Client Q&A
5. Update resource list (Discord)
